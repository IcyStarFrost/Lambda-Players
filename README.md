# Lambda Players

A sequel to Zeta Players with code that is designed to be more performant, module, and multiplayer friendly. Overall a massive upgrade from Zeta Players in every way.

Currently the project will only be located here on Github and will be seen on the workshop when the addon is considered complete by StarFrost

# What is Lambda Players and what is their purpose? 

Lambda Players are a complete rewrite of Zeta Players which are Nextbots designed to mimic Real Players in a regular Sandbox Server setting. `(This means they are meant to be in Sandbox and Sandbox only! Do not ask for them to support other gamemodes.)` Much like their Zeta counterparts, their core features are of the following:

*Whatever else a player may do*

Lambda Players like the Zetas have many options and tools you can use and play with inside their Lambda Player tab

Lambda Players are **your** players of **your** Server whether it is singleplayer or not, you have the ability to personalize your Players through custom Profile Pictures, custom names, custom text lines, custom voicelines, ect. So turn them into whatever you wish! To customize your Lambdas, please go here to learn https://github.com/IcyStarFrost/Lambda-Players/wiki/Adding-Custom-Content

## But what does Lambda have over Zeta? What makes it better?

- Lambda Players has higher performance then the Zetas
- Lambda Player's way of handling custom content is much better than the Zeta's way
- Lambda Players can work without a Navigation Mesh! However they won't be able to pathfind
- Lambda Players has official support for Multiplayer. This means Clients can not harm the Server's custom content, Lambda's features are not targetted to only the first person (`Entity(1)`) in the server, you can make clients download things like Lambda Profile Pictures by using workshop addons so they can see Profile Pictures and such, and lastly to note all the convars and settings are properly labeled whether they are Client-Side or Server-Side.
- Lambda Players have a much cleaner, optimized, and documented internal code. Look at the difference between each one's code for finding if they have permission to edit something

*Zeta Code*

Yes this is a Find function but the point stays the same

- Lambda Players are **module** which means addons can extend upon Lambda unlike the Zeta's hard coded code

- Lambda Players can appear in the default scoreboard

This feature can be turned off by turning this off in Lambda Server Settings

If you are new to Lambda, you will be surprised on the memorable moments you can get just by simply playing with them. Have a watch on the first Zeta Player Montage as it pretty much shows what I am talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz782JGfpzE&t=462s

## Origins

The inspiration to create bots that sort of mimic Players comes from 2016 and a Wiremod Expression 2 chip originally named `Paper Clip Mingebag Version 2`. Essentially it made Mingebags as a reference to War of the Servers that wander around attacking people, building contraptions, and structures.

I made a form of bot in StarfallEX which was called `Player Mimics` that basically Built structures, walked around, sit around, and speak. Sometimes when I used it in multiplayer, it actually fooled people sometimes that it wasn't a real player surprisingly enough. This was and still is my favorite StarFall Chip I have ever made even if its code is so garbage which it is.

Later I decided to make my first Glua addon which was the Zetas that had development last for months, get burnt out from them, realize how garbage the code is for Zetas, then later make a rewrite which we have now as Lambda Players. There's some lore for ya
